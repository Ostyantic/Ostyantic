<h3> ‚úèÔ∏è About Me </h3>

Hey there! My name is Anthony Lopez, I go by Ostyantic ("Ah-Stee-Ann-Tick") and I am a Software Developer with a background in Customer Care and Order Management. I currently reside in Atlanta, GA and I am a recent graduate of [Code Fellows](https://www.codefellows.org/) where I obtained my certificate in Advanced Software Development with Python. I am also an aspiring video game developer who is passionate in delivering quality gaming experiences. In my off time, there is nothing I enjoy more than just to chill out and play some videos games with friends! Outside of gaming, I also love fitness, spending time with family, and exploring the city of Atlanta!
